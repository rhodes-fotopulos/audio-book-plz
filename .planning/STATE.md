# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-03)

**Core value:** Feed in an EPUB, get out a multi-voice audiobook where each character has a distinct, fitting voice cloned from a real human recording.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — EPUB Parsing and CLI Skeleton

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (EPUB Parsing and CLI Skeleton)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-03 — Roadmap created, requirements mapped to 5 phases

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Sequential phases (not concurrent): Memory safety on 16GB M4 — LLM and TTS run in separate phases with explicit teardown at the Phase 3/4 boundary
- Python 3.11 required: Chatterbox pins sub-dependencies that break on 3.12+
- Chatterbox standard 500M model only: Turbo variant has a known Float64 MPS error — must not be used

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2: Qwen3 8B structured output reliability for fiction dialogue attribution is not fully characterised — recommend a prompt validation step at the start of Phase 2 planning
- Phase 3: LibriTTS-P subset scope (train-clean-360 vs full 100GB+ dataset) needs confirmation before Phase 3 planning
- Phase 4: Chatterbox MPS stability on Apple Silicon requires a focused validation sprint before writing production synthesis logic; set PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK=1 and run a 10-segment health check before any long run
